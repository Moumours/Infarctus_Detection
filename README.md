# Infarctus Detection

This project aims to develop and evaluate deep learning models for detecting myocardial infarction in Electrocardiograms (ECGs). The models are trained and tested on the ECG200 dataset.

## Collaborators

This project was developed in collaboration with [Tartiine](https://github.com/Tartiine/) and [Corentin Leandre](https://github.com/corentinleandre), as part of our computer science degree program.

## Dataset

This project uses the ECG200 dataset. You can find more information and download the dataset [here](https://timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG200).

## Requirements

This project is stored in a Jupyter notebook. You can run it on platforms like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

This project was built using:
- Keras 2.15.0
- TensorFlow 2.15.0

**Important:** Due to the use of .h5 files, this project is NOT compatible with Keras versions after 3.0.0.

## Getting Started

To get started, please nsure you have the required dependencies.
You first need to download the dataset, either from the link above or from this repository.
Then, simply open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or your local Jupyter Notebook.
